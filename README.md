# Analysis
After creating and analyzing my visualizations in Tableau, there were many phenomena to be uncovered.

### 1. Ridership by seasons
Ridership is highest in Summer and the start of Autumn in the month of September. Ridership is lowest in Winter months. 
People seem to ride more bikes summer than in the colder months. The possible reason could be that people are not willing to ride outside in winter due to the cold weather.
September 2019 had the highest number of records, while February 2019 had the lowest number of records


### 2. Top/Bottom Ten Stations
Top ten stations for both ending and starting a journey are Grove St PATH and Hamilton Park. The first being that the trips for the most used bikes are often started on or around the same stations, this may indicate that we need to increase our supply of bicycles in these areas.

### 4. Trip Distance and Duration by Age
If we look at the records by age, highest number of records (34,628) were recorded by people aged 51, although majority of the users are aged between 25-44 years old.The median age of riders is 31. 
In terms of the distance and duration, most young users rode citi bikes for short distance, while the older people rode for longer distance and duration.
It is clear that men ride way more citi bikes than women and unknown gender. Usage of three categories peaked during Summer, and then decreased after September.

### 5. Number of Bikes and Distance
Total number of bikes used in New York is 1,388, and their average distance ridden is 0.61 mile.
Bike with ID 29584 has the highest mileage (more than 450 miles), and is most likely due for repair or inspection.
Moreover, bikes are mostly ridden by the annual subscribers.
