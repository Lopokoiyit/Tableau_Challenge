# Tableau Homework - NYC Citi Bike Analytics
After creating and analyzing my visualizations in Tableau, there were many phenomena to be uncovered.
# Ridership by Seasons
Ridership is highest in Summer and the start of Autumn in the moonth os September. Ridership is lowest in Winter months. 
# Gender
The gender analysis shows that more males ride more than females or poeple identifying by other gender. 
# Starting Stations
The first being that the trips for the most used bikes are often started on or around the same stations, this may indicate that we need to increase our supply of bicycles in these areas.
# Age
Most of our riders are between the ages of 26 and 39 with a median age of about 31.There was about 22,000 people at the age of 51 that ride bikes. It may be wise to start having users validate their age and gender so we do not have invalid data.
